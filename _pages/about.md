I am a visiting researcher at the department of Statistical Science at UCL in the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/) research group supervised by [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io/) and [Matias Altamirano](https://maltamiranomontero.github.io/). My research focuses on robust Bayesian machine learning methods.

My research visit is supported by the Dutch National Culture fund ([Cultuurfonds](https://www.cultuurfonds.nl/)).

Previously, I completed my bachelor's and master's degree in Econometrics at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics).
